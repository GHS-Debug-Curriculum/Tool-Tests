# Welcome to CSC 3##!
## Assignment 1 - Meet the Tools

### Goals
 * Ensure each student is able to use all the tools required for this course.
 * Familiarize everyone with the tools at the most basic level.
 * Ensure that everyone can use the git repositories.

That said, I expect there will be technical difficulties that could drag this
assignment out.  That's why we're here, get all the issues out early so we don't
have to deal with it later.

### What to do
There are a series of issues open in this repository asking you to gather
information of fix bugs. Each of these can easily be obtained with one of the
tools covered in class.  Respond to each issue with the information gathered
(i.e. copy-pasted) from the tools, with a one-sentence explanation of what it
means where appropriate.

Some of the issues make ask you to fix a bug.  Make the corrections to the code
and submit a pull request to the git repository.  Be sure to associate the pull
request to the open issue.
